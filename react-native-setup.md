# React Native Setup for Tinder for Games

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install React Native CLI
npx react-native@latest init TinderForGamesRN

# Install dependencies
cd TinderForGamesRN
npm install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack
npm install react-native-svg react-native-vector-icons
npm install socket.io-client

# iOS setup
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Run on iOS Simulator
npx react-native run-ios
```

## Key Components to Port

### 1. Swipe Interface
```javascript
import { PanGestureHandler } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
import Animated, { useAnimatedGestureHandler } from 'react-native-reanimated';

// Similar swipe logic but with native performance
```

### 2. Game Room
```javascript
import { WebView } from 'react-native-webview';
// Or build native game components
```

### 3. Real-time Features
```javascript
import io from 'socket.io-client';
// Same WebSocket logic as web version
```

## Advantages of React Native Version

- **Native swipe gestures** - smoother than web
- **App store presence** - discoverable
- **Push notifications** - re-engage users
- **Offline support** - cache games locally
- **Better performance** - 60fps animations

## Development Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Core swipe interface
- **Week 3-4**: Game room and multiplayer
- **Week 5-6**: Analytics and polish
- **Week 7-8**: App store submission

## Recommendation

For MVP: **Stick with web app**
For scale: **Consider React Native after validation**
